# AFL-Project
With this project, I sought to answer a few questions related to the Australian Football League: What (player) statistics are most meaningful to team outcomes? What team or player statistics do you believe lead to playoff success? You're the GM of an Australian Rules Football teamâ€¦how should you construct a team (Star power? Balance? Depth?)? Why? Who are the top 3 players at each position overall over this period? (Is there a way to compare performance across positions?)
